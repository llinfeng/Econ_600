## Reporting an issue:

To Report an issue/correction to the texts, there are two ways: 

1. Create an "Issue" through the clicking the **Issue** tab on the right,
   represented as a excalmation mark --> describe the problem + correction;
   
2. Fork this repository --> edit the `*.tex` file --> push changes to your own
   branch --> send me a pull request.


## Time Frame & Missing notes:

As long as time permits, Linfeng will stick with his schedule and finish the raw version of the notes by midnight. 
However, due to Orientation schedules at the School of Information, 
he will not be able to attend lectures for the following sessions:

* Mon Aug 31: `10:00 - 12:00` session; 
* Tue Sep 01: `15:00 - 18:00` session;
* Wed Sep 02: `15:00 - 18:00` session;
* Thu Sep 03: `10:00 - 12:00` session;

You are more than welcomed to contribute to these missing parts of the note.
