Lecture 1: Logic, Sets and some Real Analysis 


Logic

    Proposition is a sentence that is either true or 
    false. It cannot be both true and false.

Note: ``true'' and ``false'' may not necessarily be based on any (objective/subjective) 
factual basis. However, to give a concrete example, contextually correct 
propositions are usually employed.


    Logic Connectives:  and . Let  and  be propositions 
    
        Conjunction of  and  is denoted as ;
        Disjunction of  and  is denoted as .
        Negation of  is denoted as: .
    


Truth Table is vaguely defined, with each row being a possible 
``state of the world''. On top of this, 














[ Conditionals and Biconditionals] Let  be 
    propositions, 
    
        Conditional of  and  is ;
        Biconditional of  and  is .
    

    
    











    Note that, the two 1's are obtained for free. Conditional of  and 
     are trivially true if  is false (thus the conditional is not entered, 
    thereby cannot be disproved?). Check This.

    Additionally, from http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/geometry/gp1/ifthen.htm
    an external source ( click me!):
    
        
        
        Conditionals are FALSE only when the first condition (if) is true and 
        the second condition (then) is false.  All other cases are TRUE.
    




    Two propositions are equivalent if they have the same truth table, 
    denoted using ``''.



    Claim: that  and  are equivalent.

    
        Refer to table : that by 
        definition, the truth table of the two conditionals are the same.
    

    Note, (it seems that) 
 truth tables are the same if the two ``column vectors'' denoting 
    the true/false status are the same.

















[Tautology]
    A proposition whose truth table consists only 's is called 
    tautology.



    Claim:  is a tautology.

    We introduce the following 4 types of proof: 
    
        Direct proof: to follow the direction of the statement.
            
                Proposition: For odd integers ,  is an 
                    even integer.
            
        Proof by contrapositive: (restate the proposition and prove the 
            easier direction).
            
                Proposition: If  is an odd integer 
                    (), then  is an odd integer.
                    
                        Prove instead that: ``if  is an even integer, then 
                         is an even integer''.
                    
            
        Proof by contradiction: (construct a structure that leads to 
            contradiction between derived conditions and given conditions.).
            
                That  is rational number 
.
            
        Proving a ``if and only if'' statement/proposition to be true: 
            either one of the following 4 are valid strategies: 
            
                 and ;
                 and ;
                 and ;
                 and .
            
    


Sets

[Russell's paradox]
    The barber is a man who shaves all those and only those who do not shave 
    themselves.

    In terms of set theory, let , then:
    


    which is very problematic.


[Sets]
    There are two definition of sets: 
    
        (Enumerating all elements)

            A set is a collection of objects, e.g.   
 or   .
        (Describing properties to be satisfied by elements in the set)

            If  is a set of all objects that satisfies property , then we 
            can write 
            


            where the colon means ``such that'', and  means that  
            satisfies property .
    


Now, we can define the following sets using the two definitions of sets:

    (Natural Number) ;
    (Integer) 
;
    (Rational number) 



    [Set Equality]
    Two sets  and  are equal if they have the same elements. That is: 
    


    Note, that the notion  was used sloppily here. Without loss of 
    generality, it shall better be .



    [Set Containment]
    A set  is contained in a set , denoted by , if 
.

    As a consequence,  if and only if  and 
.




    [Cardinality (finite case)]

    If a set  has   distinct elements, then  is the cardinality of  
    and we call  a finite set. The cardinality of  is denoted by 
    .



    [Empty set ]
    The empty set is the set with no element. 



    [Power set ]
    Let  be a set. The power set of  is the collection of all 
    subsets of . 

    Note that,  is an arbitrary set. It could be finite, in which case  
    easy to envision; At the other extreme, it could be a uncountable set. 
    Nevertheless, the following equality shall hold: 

    



    
        Let , then 
. In terms of notation, note that  is an element in , thus 
        ; yet,  is a subset of , thus .

Also note that, completeness implies reflectiveness.


    [Equivilance relation]

    An equivalence on set  is a relation  that is 
    reflective, symmetric and transitive. It is denoted as .

    For any , the equivalence class of  with respect to 
     is defined to be the set 
    


Remark: by construction in Definition ,  equivalence 
() is defined as ``a relation on '', which is thereby defined in the 
Cartesian space.


    [Fucntion: defined using Relation from  to ]
    A function from set  to set  is a relation  from  to  such

    [Axiom of Real Number: completeness axiom]

Sequence and Convergence

    A set  is a linearly ordered set if there is a relation 
    ``'' on  s.t.

    
         is complete, transitive and antisymmetric.
    

    Note that, given the linear ordering, we can define  accordingly. 
    (For arbitrary  and , then we say  if  and 
    .)



    [Boundedness for an arbitrary set.]

    Let  be a linearly ordered set and , then  is 
    the supremum (or least upper bound) of  if: 
    
         itself is an upper bound of , i.e.

    Corolloary:  For , , there

    [Completeness Axiom] 
    If  is a nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above, then there 
    exists a least upper bound.



    [Sequence in ]
    A sequence of real number is a function  s.t.  is 
    the -th component of the sequence .




     is bounded if  is bounded.

    Note, here  is the set of all natural numbers . Thus, 
    we hereby define the boundedness of a sequence using the our previous 
    definition of set-boundedness.



    
    A monotone bounded sequence converges.



    [Subsequence]

    A subsequence  of  is a sequence s.t.

      conversion function  s.t.  and 
     whenever . We can also write: 
.



    
    Every sequence of  has a monotone subsequence.

    
        Proof by doodling: try to construct a decreasing sequence first, if 
        failed (cannot identify infinitely many of elements as candidate of the 
        sequence), construct an increasing one.

        Formally: let 
. 
        
            if  (countably infinite)
                 
, we have 
                found a monotone (decreasing) sequence.

                 s.t. . Since , 
                there exists  s.t. .

                We can construct an increasing sequence in this fashion.
        
    



    [Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem] 
    
    A bounded sequence of  has a convergent subsequence.
    
        By Lemma , such bounded sequence of  has a 
        monotone subsequence, which inebriates the boundedness property.
        
        Thus, by Lemma , such bounded monotone sequence 
        converges.

     is a Cauchy sequence if ,  s.t. 
    , .


Note that, since the definition of convergent sequence relies on knowing the 
limit , when such limit is not attainable, Cauchy becomes handy.


    
    Every convergent sequence is Cauchy.
    
        Given , thus 
  s.t. , 
.

        Now, for any , we have: 
        





    


Example: 
Prove that  converges for , .


    [Step 1]
        First observe that:  is an average of two real numbers that are in . Thus, 
            .

        Also observe that by rearranging the terms in the equality, we 
            have: 
            


    
    At this point, we check definition of Cauchy sequence by showing that: for 
    arbitrary , we can find a  such that 
. Deriving the functional form of  suffices. (We 
    can then use this functional form to find a proper .)

    Without loss of generality, let , then:
    












    By now, we can easily demonstrates that the definition of Cauchy sequence 
    could be satisfied by choosing a proper  for any given 
    .



    Every Cauchy sequence is bounded.
    
     Let  be an arbitrary Cauchy sequence. Then, for for 
        arbitrary , we know that  such 
        that , .

        Now, to construct an upper bound for , without loss of 
        generality, let . Then, we know that there exists 
 such that , . Then, let  
        denote the bound (either upper or lower). Then, in absolute value, we can 
        define it to be: 
        



        Through more careful, yet unnecessary, discussions, we can derive the 
        exact bound using the absolute value .

        Note that, the bound we found above is only one of the upper 
        bound. It is not necessarily the  nor .
    



    
    Every Cauchy sequence in  
     

    
    converges.
     Let  be an arbitrary Cauchy sequence. 
        We want to show  converges to some . That is to 
        show: ,  s.t. 
, .

        (Step 1:) For arbitrary , given that  is a Cauchy 
        sequence, for ,  s.t. 
        



        (Step 2:) By Lemma , we know that every Cauchy 
        sequence is bounded.
        Thus, by Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem (Theorem ), we 
        know that  for some certain real number 
.  a is Limit! 
 By definition of 
        convergence of (sub)sequence, for the arbitrary  that we 
        started with,  s.t.
        



        Now, let , we see that  and 
        , we have: 
        





        Note:  is an arbitrary element of the subsequence  
        that we found convergent through B-W Theorem.

        Also note that,  follows from 
        Step 1 that  is Cauchy to start with.

        contradiction. Suppose that  s.t. no such 
 exists. Then, we know that  cannot serve the role of . 
        So, for some , 
        


        Still,  cannot serve the role of , then for some 
, 
        
        By induction, we can construct a subsequence that is bounded from below by 
        . Note that, the original sequence is bounded from 
        above, by Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, we know that a bounded sequence 
        converges. However, the limit of such subsequence shall be larger than , 
        contradicting .

        Thus what we assumed is wrong. We thereby proved the original claim in

        .

    Now, for arbitrary , by definition of limsup, we know that 
    
 s.t.  (a 
    subsequence of ) s.t. .

    For this convergent subsequence per se, given the arbitrary  we 
    have specified in the very beginning, we know that  s.t. 
    




    Now, for arbitrary , we can always find a  with , 
    such that  is within  distance away 
    from . Combining this fact with the construction that 
, it is clear the  we found specifically for 
     and  satisfies: .
    













    
        Prove that (i) and (ii) implies that .
    
    To prove that , we first show that  is the limit of a 
    subsequence of ; then we show that  s.t.  
    is the limit of a subsequence of .

    Firstly, by (i) and (ii), for arbitrary , we can find a 
    subsequence  with certain  
    such that , . 
    (Step 1: by (i), we can find a  for arbitrary 
, so that:  ; Step 2, for the  
           and all , we can find a  
           s.t.  . Thus, we have composed a 
       subsequence .)

    Then, suppose  as the limsup, then  
     s.t. , . 
    However, (i) is violated when : suppose that 
    . Then,  s.t. , 
. Given that , there does not 
    exist a  that may satisfy (i). (The ``'' statement is 
    violated due to the subsequence that converges to .)

    Alternatively, one can prove the statement using an equivalent definition of 
    limsup: 
    




    Thus, (i) implies that ,  s.t. 
:
    


    Therefore, 
 ;

    At the same time, (ii) implies that , for arbitrary 
    ,  s.t. . Then:
    


    Therefore,

    [Infinite series]
    Given a sequence , let  be a sequence 
    , it is called infinite series. 
    We write  if  converges to .
    
        For , we can obtain an expression for 
; 
        and .

        Also note that the sum of arbitrary segment of  can be 
        arbitrarily large if the length of such segment is long enough.

    natural number appears exactly once. Let , then  is

    [Absolute convergence]
    If  converges, we say that  
    converges absolutely.
    
    (e.g. for , , yet 
    .)



    If  converges absolutely, then 
, where  is a rearrangement of .
    
    Note that, rearranging  can give raise to arbitrary 
    partial sum .


Review: subsets in 
Epistemic-wise, we established the construction of following sets sequentially:

    : The set of integers; [It is also countable. In fact, .
    : The set of rational number; [It is also countable, and 
        dense.]
    : The real line. [Completeness Axiom]
